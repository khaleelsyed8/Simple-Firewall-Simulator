# Simple Firewall Simulator

### Simple Projects #2

Welcome to the Simple Firewall Simulator! This interactive tool allows you to simulate configuring firewall rules and visualize their effects. It's designed to help you understand how different rules impact network traffic and enhance your knowledge of firewall configurations.

## Features

- **Rule Configuration**: Create and adjust firewall rules with an intuitive interface.
- **Simulation**: See how your rules affect incoming and outgoing traffic in real-time.
- **Animations**: Enjoy elegant animations that illustrate rule application and network traffic flow.
- **Web Browser Simulator**: (Optional) Test how rules interact with a simulated web browser based on your configurations.

## How It Works

1. **Add Rules**: Use the interface to define firewall rules, specifying criteria like source and destination IPs, ports, and actions.
2. **Simulate Traffic**: Observe how different rules impact simulated network traffic.
3. **View Results**: Check the results of your configuration and make adjustments as needed.
